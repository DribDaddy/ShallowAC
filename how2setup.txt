STEP 1: Download the ".mcpack" file.
STEP 2: With Minecraft open, double click the ".mcpack" file.
STEP 3: Add the behavior pack into a world or realm.
STEP 4: Enter the world, and place a repeating command block and set it to always active.
STEP 5: Put the command "/function shallow/start/callfunctions" into the command block.

And you're done! The command block will fire off and will do everything else for you.

DO NOT REMOVE/MOVE THE COMMAND BLOCK.

(Also, make sure to give your admins and yourself the tag "mod", so: "/tag {person} add mod".)
