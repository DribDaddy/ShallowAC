If the person has no chat rank, they will get a golden colored Member rank
--note you can have more than 1 rank and it will display all of those ranks--
To add ranks to people do the following command on the player:
/tag <player> add "SAC.your rank here"
example if I wanted to add the staff rank to a player
/tag THErealDIVIJ add "SAC.Staff" {colors also allowed through use of "ยง"}
then in chat it would display 
[Staff] THErealDIVIJ: msg here
