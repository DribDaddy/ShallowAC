# ShallowAC
Shallow (MCBE) Anti-Cheat, a very lightweight anticheat capable of defending against exploiters, griefers, and hackers. 

# How can ShallowAC help with my server/realm?
We have MANY moderator tools for managing members, such as;
   - Freeze
   - Inventory View *(Shows admins a certain users inventory (only says NAMES of items, not enchantments.))*
   - Admin-Grab *(Pick up members and entities using a blaze rod, ONLY WORKS FOR ADMINS!!!)*
   - Error-Logs *(Records and reports problems found running the anticheat.)*
   - Member auto-monitor *(Set a certain person for the anticheat to focus on, when something is detected near them, they are instantly banned.)*
   - Insta-Spawn *(Creates a premade spawn with built-in spawn protection and kits, you can pick from survival, creative, modern, medieval, and more!)*
   - And Much more! *(More tools coming soon...)*

# What can ShallowAC do?
We have features such as;
   - Anti-Fly *(When floating too long without permission, the Anti-Fly will forcefully place you back down.)*
   - Anti-CBE *(Detects entities that may be used to cause harm.)*
   - Anti-GM *(Stops and warns a user for changing gamemodes without permission.)*
   - Backup systems *(Just in case the other systems fail, very rarely.)*
   - Much more to be added soon!
